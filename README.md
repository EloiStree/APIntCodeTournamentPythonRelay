# APInt Code Tournament Python Relay

> Offer Python code that bridges the game with the programs written by tournament participants.

Direct communication works for solo mini-games, but multiplayer tournaments need an intermediate relay to manage, filter, and control interactions.

This repository delivers the Python glue that links participant code with the game(s).
